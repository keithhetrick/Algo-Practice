// 8. Phone Call

// Some phone usage rate may be described as follows:

// first minute of a call costs min1 cents,
// each minute from the 2nd up to 10th (inclusive) costs min2_10 cents
// each minute after 10th costs min11 cents.
// You have s cents on your account before the call. What is the duration of the longest call (in minutes rounded down to the nearest integer) you can have?

// Example
// For min1 = 3, min2_10 = 1, min11 = 2, and s = 20, the output should be
// solution(min1, min2_10, min11, s) = 14.

// Here's why:

// the first minute costs 3 cents, which leaves you with 20 - 3 = 17 cents;
// the total cost of minutes 2 through 10 is 1 * 9 = 9, so you can talk 9 more minutes and still have 17 - 9 = 8 cents;
// each next minute costs 2 cents, which means that you can talk 8 / 2 = 4 more minutes.

// Thus, the longest call you can make is 1 + 9 + 4 = 14 minutes long.

function solution(min1, min2_10, min11, s) {
  let minOneSum = s - min1;
  let minTwoSum = min2_10 * 9;
  let minThreeSum = Math.floor((minOneSum - minTwoSum) / min11);

  if (s === min1) return 1;
  if (minOneSum - minTwoSum < 0) return 1 + Math.floor((s - min1) / min2_10);
  return 10 + minThreeSum;
